# Data Science

These projects aim to build my confidence and skills in data science. I will be working on various data analysis and machine learning tasks, exploring different datasets, and implementing algorithms to gain practical experience in the field. Through these projects, I hope to deepen my understanding of data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling techniques.
Additionally, I plan to collaborate with other data scientists and participate in Kaggle competitions to further enhance my skills and learn from the community. By continuously expanding my knowledge and applying it to real-world problems, I aim to become a proficient data scientist capable of making meaningful insights and driving data-driven decision-making processes.
