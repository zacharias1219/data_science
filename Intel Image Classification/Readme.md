# Intel Image Classification

## Summary

This project is an example of how to use the Intel® Neural Compressor for image classification tasks. The code in this repository demonstrates how to quantize a PyTorch model and then
This project contains code for image classification using the Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick. The code is written in Python and utilizes the TensorFlow* software library
